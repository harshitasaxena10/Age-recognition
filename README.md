# Age-recognition
This is an age recognition model which can be used for various applications:
1. It can be used for age restricted content filtering to prevent minors from accessing adult content.
2. Personalized advertising: This model can be used to deliver ads that are relevant to the age group of the viewers.
3. Retail analytics: Retailers can use an age detection model to anayse the age distribution of their customers and adjust their product offerings accordingly.
4. Security: This model can be used to allow entry of a particular age group in a restricted region.

The code uses the model age_net.caffemodel for determining the age groups. The first python file (i.e. Q1age2.py) takes real time images for the detection. While the second python file (i.e. Q2age3.py) takes a video feed to determine the age. 
I have also included sample output pictures of both the codes.
